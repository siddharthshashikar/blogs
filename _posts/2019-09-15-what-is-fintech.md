FinTech, uses information technology to transform the way finance is being done in global markets and emerging nations. RegTech or Regulatory technology may be a game changer as it will allow  financial institutions to deal with regulatory and compliance burdens not only more effectively but also more efficiently.

Now letâ€™s understand how FinTech became such a big reality? What really caused FinTech to rise?

Traditionally as technology evolved banks were pretty good at always keeping up with the technology and in many cases begin the early adopters. But this all really changed during the financial crisis in 2008.

During that time, financial institutions were busy dealing with regulations, compliance and many other regulatory enforcement situations that were taking place. Innovation became very distant priority. But at the same time some of the game changing innovations like Uber, Airbnb, WhatsApp and others that took place and really changed the way customer ahead experience the services they were receiving in many industries except financial industries.

Ergo, creating a gap between what financial institutions were offering and what the customers came to expect. And this gap is what FinTech industry tackles. Over the years it can been seen that some of the biggest game changing contributions to the industry took place not only by startups but by large financial institutions.

Some of the advantages these large financial institution has over startups? Not only they have funding, backlog, talent and capital pool to actually support these new business but to a certain extent they have trust of consumers.

Amazon has Amazon Pay, Google has Google Pay, Alibaba has Alipay. These firms know the power of trust any they are leveraging it for the good.
