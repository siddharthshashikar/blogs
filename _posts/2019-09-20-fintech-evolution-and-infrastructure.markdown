Finance and Technology have been inextricably intertwined since the very beginning. Technology has always been involved to make the process more efficient and effective beit finance, medical, food industry etc.

Now modern day finTech begins somewhere around 150 years ago as we generally mark the day as 1867!

##### Huh 1867?

In the year 1867, first ever transatlantic cable was laid. These transatlantic cables made instantaneous communications between major markets such as New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong possible. This is the basic infrastructure that is underlying under the modern day finTech.

Itâ€™s interesting to note that more number of cables have been laid in past 5 years than in the past 150 years combined and the reason is more and more cable is required to handle ever growing flow of data between these major markets.

Now lets see how finTech evolved during the world war.

Before world war 1, the period was known for its financial and economic globalization which was underpinned by technology by laying of transatlantic cable also called as Victorian internet. It  played one of the major roles connecting major markets across the globe. Which further lead to increased economic and financial globalization as cross border movements  of goods, services, information etc. increased drastically.

During the second world war significant effort was given on developing codes for building secure communication channels, as well as significant development in breaking those codes were done. These developments of encoding and decoding codes led to groundbreaking thinking in the field of computer technology.

After the second world war as the world economy slowly started rebuilding and we begin to see progressive development of those early computer technology which laid the groundwork for the sort of finTech and regTech developments we see today.
