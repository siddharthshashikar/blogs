Hi! 
I have recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from NIIT University (2014-18). In my  entire B.Tech journey I was continuously exposed to different projects & situations, both academically and non-academically. Apart from that I'm currenlty in love with Python.  

### About this Blog

Ok Guys! Let me cut the chase, this is not a technical blog, its actually an experience blog, where I will be sharing the experiences of the projects & situations that I have encountered, including how I tackled the thing and what worked and what didn't.

Hope you find these blogs useful!!

If yes, I'm happy for you!!!

If no, I wish you luck, that you find what you are looking for!!!

And as my friend always said, "SEEK, YOU SHALL FIND"
