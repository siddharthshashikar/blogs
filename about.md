Hi! 
I have recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from NIIT University (2014-18). In my  entire B.Tech journey I was continuously exposed to different projects & situations, both academically and non-academically. Apart from that I'm currenlty in love with Python and having an affair with C++.
